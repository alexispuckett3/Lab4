## Project Summary:

## Design/Methods:

For this lab we needed:
* A bread board
* Two DC Power supplies (DCPS)
* A Function Generator
* An Oscilloscope
* Resistors with resistances of 1k&Omega;, 4.7k&Omega;, 8.2k&Omega;, two 68k&Omega;, 150k&Omega;, 270k&Omega;, 270k&Omega;, 330k&Omega;, and 1.5M&Omega;
* A capacitor of 0.1&mu;F
* An LM741 Op Amp
* A 1k&Omega;, a 10k&Omega;, and a 100k&Omega; trimmer potentiometer

We began by measuring the actual resistances and capacitances of the resistors and capacitors we used throughout this lab. Below are the measured values. 

| Nominal Value| Actual Value |
|:---:|---|
| 68 k&Omega;   | 66.8 k&Omega;     |
| 68 k&Omega;   | 66.8 k&Omega;     |
| 150 k&Omega;  |  148.1 k&Omega;   |
| 270 k&Omega;  | 271.5 k&Omega;    |
| 330 k&Omega;  |  337.2 k&Omega;   |
| 1.5 M&Omega;  |  1.5 M&Omega;     |
| 1 k&Omega;    |  0.986 k&Omega;   |
| 4.7 k&Omega;  |  4.599 k&Omega;   |
| 8.2 k&Omega;  |  8.07 k&Omega;    |
| 0.1 &mu;F     |  0.1023 &mu;F     |

We ended up only using one potentiometer for the first circuit. We used the 10k&Omega; which had a measured resistance of 9.86k&Omega;.
